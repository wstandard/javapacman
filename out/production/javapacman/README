(This isn't for a turn in, this is just to remind me how.  I don't guarantee that this will work
 and certainly don't want this functionality graded :-) )
First, edit the code to access the images differently (search code for JAR)
Then, do the following commands

jar cf Pacman.jar *.class img/ sounds/
Then sign using...
jarsigner Pacman.jar alias
(You have to set up jarsigner!)
